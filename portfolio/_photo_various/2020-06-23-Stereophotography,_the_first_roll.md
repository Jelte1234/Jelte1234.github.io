Recently, I came across an old Russian stereocamera. It's been something I wanted to try for a while, so I jumped at the chance. This model of camera was produced from 1955 to 1974 with only slight differences. My example is one of the later ones, between 1964-74. The camera takes a pair of 6x6 images on 120 film whenever you press the shutter, making it a very expensive camera to run. After a mere six image pairs a roll is full.
From an engineering standpoint, the camera could hardly be much simpler- it's a bakelite box, with three lenses on the front. Functionally, it's the same as most TLR (twin lens reflex) cameras, just with an extra lens. Gears link the lenses so that they are all focused identically. Aperture controls and the shutters are linked internally. The lenses are uncoated, meaning they're prone to flaring. All in all, it's a basic, but easy to understand device. And, while basic, it's able to produce results still!

Looking up at this building gives a certain dwarfing sensation, that's impossible to capture in 2D.

When using this camera, the way you have to look at the world around you changes. Where most cameras produce a flat image, which makes distances seem irrelevant, (except for perspective) when using this camera, you acutely become more aware of the distances between objects, and have to think about how leading lines work in 3d.

In this picture, I tried to explore leading lines in a different direction, and see how a low camera standpoint affects the perception

Here, I added some Red/Blue anaglyph glasses to the front of the camera. It not only looks silly, but it filters the incoming light. The idea behind this was to use the filtering to get different color intensities on each picture, to get a duotone image in the end. (not full color, since no green was registered.) Upon viewing, the same glasses are worn, hopefully giving the effect of some color in the image.

Theoretically, this image should be viewed with red/blue anaglyph glasses. However, it didn't work out entirely anyway. Due to the pole being saturated red, it's not showing up at all to the blue eye, whereas it's the same intensity as the white for the red eye. So, while the effect is interesting, it isn't suitable for saturated colors at least. Perhaps a less-strong filter could work for this application, however I don't have those on hand.
