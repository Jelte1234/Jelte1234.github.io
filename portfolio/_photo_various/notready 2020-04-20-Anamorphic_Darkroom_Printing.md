If you carefully watch a hollywood movie, you might notice some oval bokeh, big, horizontal flares- and of course the   W I D E   screen. These are all caused by using an Anamorphic lens during recording, also known as "Cinemascope". This was used to capture a widescreen-image onto a standard movie film format, thereby maximizing the image quality. (because the whole area was used, instead of black bars) If you know how expensive it is to record movies on film, you'll also appreciate wanting to use it all. Nowadays, they're mostly used for the distinct look they have, and, because of big movies using them, they have a "cinematic" quality that's much sought after.
Historically, the cinema cameras would use a purpose-built single lens for this, whereas for projecting, a two-lens setup is fine, where the anamorphic adapter is- well- an adapter. This makes the projector capable of normal and anamorphic movies. Since analog projectors aren't widely used anymore, home users have put these projection lenses on other cameras, with great looks and slight hassle as a result. The anamorphics also need to be focussed...
Anyway, enough about the history. On to the pictures.

  This was my setup for these pictures- the excellent Nikon FE with a 100mm lens, and the Proskar anamorphic-16 adapter, originally built for 16mm projectors. While a bit long, it's still fairly portable and not too heavy.
