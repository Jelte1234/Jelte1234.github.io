Inspired by other photographer's "photowalks" here's the first Photoswim that I know of. Using the Nikonos III with the amazing 15mm UW lens, it actually gets a wider field of view than an action camera!
Pictures were taken on Agfa APX-400 at an estimated iso2500, (I did not yet have a submersible lightmeter) and then stand-developed in Rodinal. The negatives also print well in the darkroom.
