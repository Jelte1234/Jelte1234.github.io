In 2019, I visited DroneClash. Since I recently got my first anamorphic lens, this was the ideal place to test it out! Big lights, fireballs, and of course drone battles. In the train there I was listening to the John Wick soundtrack, which inspired the final music choice for this track. (same artist)
Also, this video was my first time working with Resolve as editing software. All shots were hand-held, using my trusty Nikon D7000 with it's 50mm f/1.8D lens, and the Proskar Anamorphic-16 adapter, which I've since also [used for photography](/photography/various/2020-04-19-anamorphic-photography) and [darkroom printing](/photography/various/2020-04-20-anamorphic-darkroom-printing)
